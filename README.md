## About Me

```
Hello CSE 110!
```

Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a junior studying *Computer Engineering* at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is South Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego. 

> I have a separate webiste of myself [here](https://7174andy.github.io/).

## Experience

Computer engineering can be utilized in numerous diverse fields, such as bioengineering, physics, and others. Therefore, one of the most important aspect of being a successful computer engineer is to have diverse experience at different fields. I have worked as the following roles: 
- full-stack developer
- tutor
- software developer
- research assisstant
- project leader

These priceless experiences not only strengthened my computer engineering background but also understood how computer engineering can be applied to other fields, such as education and governmental documents.

## Why Computer Engineering?

The first time I encountered the concept of coding was when I was in middle school learning Scratch. This is when I fell in love with programming and was intrigued by coding because I can contruct whatever I want using lines of codes. The blank Java file on the screenâ€™s IDE is like a white canvas where I can draw whatever I imagine. And I chose computer engineering to solidify my imaginations and to bring them in real life.

## Goals

In this class, I want to learn the following components of software engineering: 

- [x] Learn how to use GitHub effectively
- [ ] Learn how to collaborate with others
- [ ] Build a meaningful project
- [ ] Learn how to write a good documentation
