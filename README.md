## About Me

Hi, I am Andrew Park. I am currently a junior studying *Computer Engineering* at UC San Diego. Although my primary background is South Korea, I was blended with diverse cultures: I was born in North Carolina and lived there for five years. Then, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, and lived there for another five years, and I moved to Shanghai, China. At last, I ended up here at San Diego. 

I have a separate webiste of myself [here](https://7174andy.github.io/).
